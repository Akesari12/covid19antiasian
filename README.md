Investigation the relationship between COVID-19 and the Anti-Asian Climate

## Workflow
1. Downalod and unzip [the large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3902855#.XvZFBXVKhEZ), created by [Panacealab](http://www.panacealab.org/) (v.15) and remove all extracted files except the English Twitter data (2.3 GB).

- I took all of these steps in the command-line interface to increase efficiency, transparency and reproducibility. The tsv file (`clean_language_en.tsv`) contains 59,650,755 observations.

```bash
# Download the file in the raw_data subdirectory of the project directory

$ curl -O https://zenodo.org/record/3902855/files/clean_languages.tar.gz?download=1

# Check the downloaded file, including information on its size
$ ls -lh

# Unpakcg the .tar.gz file
$ tar -xzf 'clean_languages.tar.gz?download=1'

# The above command will create combined_languages subdirectory.

# Change directory to the subdirectory then move the English twitter data to the parent directory and then remove the subdirectory

$ cd combined_languages | mv clean_language_en.tsv ../ | rm-r combined_languages/

# Inspect the English Twitter data
$ head clean_language_en.tsv

# Count the number of rows in the tsv file
$ wc -l clean_language_en.tsv

# 59,650,755
```

2. Hydrate the Tweet IDs

- The publicly available Twitter data only contains Tweet IDs to comply with Twitter's [Terms of Service](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy). I turned these Tweet IDs back into JSON data (Tweets) using [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc). If you were using Twarc for the first time, refer to [this tutorial](https://github.com/alblaine/twarc-tutorial).

- To ease hydration, I first randomly selected 120,000 Tweet IDs from the dataset starifying on the months in which these tweets were created. I then saved the sampled data in a new file named `sampled.tsv`. The TSV file has four columns: `Tweet IDs`, `date`, `time`, and `month`. Since we only need the first column, I selected it and saved it as a separate file named `sampled1.tsv`. I took this step in R as `fread` package is fast even for importing and wrangling a 2.3 GB TSV file.

- Now, hydrate in the terminal using `twarc`.

```bash
# Hydrate
$ twarc hydrate sampled1.tsv > sampled.jsonl

# Check the number of tweets.
$ grep -o 'INFO archived' twarc.log | wc -l
```

The next step is turn the JSON file into a CSV file using [json2csv](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2018-03-20-twitter-command-line).

```bash
# Install json2csv
git clone https://github.com/DocNow/twarc.git
pip install -e twarc

# Turn JSON into CSV
